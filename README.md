## About The Project

These types of captchas do not require image processing and making special models to extract letters and image-to-text models. Because these types of captchas do not have an image nature, these captchas are a type of SVG code that, by having a decoder model, You can return the code to the adjusted text, I gave a more complete explanation of this function below .

This function converts an SVG file to text using a model defined as a string within the class :

  1- Reading the model: First, we load the model, which is defined as a Base64-encoded string within the class, and decode it to a JSON string.

  2- Reading the SVG file: Next, we read the text of the SVG file and store it in a string.

  3- Parsing the SVG text: We parse the SVG text using the minidom library in Python to make it easier to work with.

  4- Finding path elements without stroke: Among the path elements in the SVG file, we find those that do not have a stroke. Elements with a stroke usually represent visible text in the image, and we don't need them for the purpose of copying.

  5- Parsing the paths: For each path without a stroke, we examine the path coordinates and associate them as input patterns to the relevant model.

  6-  Generating text based on the model: Based on the given model, we convert each input pattern into a corresponding letter or number and add it to a loop list.

  7-  Combining letters and numbers: We combine the letters and numbers resulting from the conversion of paths and return a final string as the ultimate answer.

This process allows the user to extract hidden text by sending an SVG file containing hidden code and using the associated model to extract it.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AmireNoori/SVG-Captcha-Solver
   ```

This tool does not use additional libraries and all modules like `base64` , `xml` and etc are built-in in python


## Usage

This tool is written in the form of a library that you can easily import and use in your script or bot.

* An example of how to use :

_Create a `main.py` file and enter the following codes in it._

* Example
  ```sh
  from SVG_Captcha_Solver import SvgCaptchaSolver

  solver = SvgCaptchaSolver()

  result = solver.solve_captcha("SVG FILE PATH") #img/captcha.svg

  print(result)
  ```
* Terminal
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```

* Output
  ```sh
  g7TdR
  ```
